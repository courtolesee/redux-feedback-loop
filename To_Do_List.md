## TODO

<!-- - Create a multi-part form that allows users to leave feedback for today. There will be 4 views for the form parts. -->
<!-- - While there is no nav bar, each part of the form should be at its own route. Clicking next should move the user 
    - to the appropriate step in the process. -->
<!-- - Each step should only allow the user to advance to the next step if a score was provided. Be sure to tell the 
    - user in some way that a value must be provided. -->
<!-- - The Comments step does not need to be validated, an empty value is okay. -->
<!-- - The last step of the process will allow the user to review their feedback. Users are not able to change 
    - their input on this step or go back for Base Mode. -->
<!-- - The Review step needs to have a submit button which will be clicked on to actually submit the completed feedback to the server. -->
<!-- - When the submit button is clicked, save the submission in the database. The user should see a submission success page. They 
    - can then click the button to take a new survey, which needs to reset all the data and go back to the first step. -->
